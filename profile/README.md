# pocketo-app

A clone version of the Pocket web app.

Nice to see you here. I'm Vu Tong from the Pocketo team.

I want to develop Pocketo into a high-quality open-source software (OSS), focus on documentation, code quality, architecture, testing, and deployment.

Feel free to submit an issue or send a pull request.

## Getting started

We use Trello, Google Drive, GitHub, and Docker Hub for the project. Check out the links below, which are available for everyone.
